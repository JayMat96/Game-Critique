#### Critique of selected game and aspects that should be tested

## Review

A Hat in Time is a cartoony collectathon platformer created by Jonas Kaerlev of Gears for Breakfast. It would fall more in line with the intermediate gamer. The player explores different worlds and must collect the Time Pieces. Each level ends when the player collects the Time Piece for that level. 

There are also other things to collect such as gifts, tokens, and pons. Pons are the in-game currency used to buy Badges. There are also Heart Pons which restore the player's health. If you collect all the gifts in a set, you can unlock more levels. Tokens can be used to earn cosmetic changes for the player, their hats, or a new music track for worlds. After playing A Hat in Time, I found some aspects of the game that a tester would have looked at when testing the game.

## What Needs Testing

A Hat in Time has some platforming elements that I think should be tested. These are the double, along with the single jump of course, walljumping, and wallrunning. This is too make sure the player understands how they can move arounod the game and what their limitations are.

One function that should be checked frequently is the different abilities that come with each hat. The player can equip different hats which give the player new abilities. It would be wise to always check that the hats do their proper power when equipped and only when the correct hat is equipped.

Another function that should be checked has to do with another equippable item called "Badges." These provide an additional ability or change to the overall gameplay alongwith the hats. There is one Badge that only affects one hat, and there are some that do not affect the hats' powers, but the player or the world around them. This should be tested so as to not negate any of the hats' powers and that they work correctly.

There is a small in-game store where the player can use in-game currency (pons) to buy Badges. There should be some testing done to make sure the Badges are not too expensive or too cheap. This is to make sure the player sees pons as a collectable worth picking up.
