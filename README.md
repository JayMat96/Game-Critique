#### Critique of selected game and aspects that should be tested

## Review

Type 1-2 paragraphs reviewing selected game. Your audience is the class, keep your review simple and understandable to a novice tester. 

Name 3-5 aspects of the game you think should be tested and why?

Example: 

The tennis game on Wii Sports is a very fun and easy game to play. The maker of Wii sports is Nintendo and there are several other sports that can be played on the Wii Sports game disc. After playing the tennis game on Wii Sports, there are several functions I think a tester would look at.

One function that would be looked at immediately is the player mode/selection. A total of four players can play a tennis match; this can be done with 1 Wii remote or multiple Wii remotes. Another important function that might be tested is the player movement, making sure the direction you are moving is in line with the game.  Scoring would be another major function that should be tested, if a player hits the ball out of bound or hits the net, making sure a proper out occurs and the scoring is incremented correctly.


A Hat in Time is a collectathon platformer created by Jonas Kaerlev of Gears for Breakfast. The player explores different worlds and must collect the Time Pieces. Each level ends when the player collects the Time Piece for that level. There are also other things to collect such as gifts, tokens, and pons. Pons are the in-game currency used to buy Badges. If you collect all the gifts in a set, you can unlock more levels. Tokens can be used to earn cosmetic changes for the player, their hats, or a new music track for worlds.

A Hat in Time has some platforming elements that I think should be tested. These are the double, along with the single jump of course, walljumping, and wallrunning.

One function that should be checked frequently is the different abilities that come with each hat. The player can equip different hats which give the player new abilities. It would be wise to always check that the hats do their proper power when equipped and only when the correct hat is equipped.

Another function that should be checked has to do with another equippable item called "Badges." These provide an additional ability or change to the overall gameplay alongwith the hats. There is one Badge that only affects one hat, and there are some that do not affect the hats' powers, but the player or the world around them. This should be tested so as to not negate any of the hats' powers and that they work correctly.

There is a small in-game store where the player can use in-game currency to buy Badges. There should be some testing done to make sure the Badges are not overpriced.
